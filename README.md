## Description

INSOMNIA is our tech-inspired, fictional electronica band.
We designed INSOMNIA’s website to be different from other band websites:

- We wanted the site’s animation to reflect the music’s energy
- The color scheme to mimic the look and feel of being at a show
- And for the site to feel like an exclusive experience for fans.

Once a superfan signs up and logs in, they have access to exclusive content. They can interact with other fans in the forum, as well as with the band! Being a music fan is a unique experience, but one that you want to share with your community. Our design helps bring fans together to support INSOMNIA’s music. As music fans, we wanted to create a band page that was interactive, fun to visit, and has an exclusive look and feel.
